# Banana navigation project from Udacity deep RL nanodegree.
In this project we train an agent to navigate a 2D space collecting yellow bananas and avoiding blue bananas.

## Setup
First, we need to install the necessary Python packages and set up the environment. Follow steps 1-6. from [this](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies) github page. During step 3., make sure to install the required environments by running:
```
pip install gym[classic_control]
pip install gym[box2d]
```

You may or may not need to install some of the packages manually. In my case, in addition to following the instructions, I had to run:
```
pip install torch
```
and
```
pip install unityagents
```
